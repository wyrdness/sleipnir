## Overview

Sleipnir is the eight-legged grey horse of Odin, the Allfather in Norse mythology. Born from the trickster god Loki (who transformed into a mare) and the jötunn's stallion Svaðilfari, Sleipnir is described as the best and fastest of all horses.

With eight legs, Sleipnir can travel across land, sea, and air, and journey between the Nine Worlds of Norse cosmology, including the realm of the dead. The horse famously carried Hermóðr to Hel in an attempt to retrieve the god Baldr. Sleipnir's teeth are carved with runes, marking his magical nature.

As Odin's exclusive mount, Sleipnir symbolizes shamanic journeys, the crossing of boundaries between life and death, and the ability to traverse all realms of existence.

## Mythology & Origin

### Birth Story

Sleipnir was born during the building of Asgard's wall. The Æsir (gods) hired a builder who promised to complete the wall in an impossible timeframe, with the sun, moon, and goddess Freyja as payment. When his stallion **Svaðilfari** made success likely, the gods panicked.

Loki transformed into a beautiful mare and lured Svaðilfari away from the work. Later, Loki gave birth to an eight-legged grey foal—Sleipnir—which Loki gifted to Odin.

**Parents**:
- **Mother**: Loki (shape-shifted as mare)
- **Father**: Svaðilfari (jötunn's stallion)

### Major Myths

#### 1. The Building of Asgard's Wall

The gods needed Asgard's wall completed but regretted their promise to pay the builder. Loki's seduction of Svaðilfari (as a mare) caused the builder to fail, saving the gods from their bargain. The result was Sleipnir's birth.

#### 2. Hermóðr's Ride to Hel

When Baldr the Beautiful was killed by Höðr (manipulated by Loki), the gods mourned. Hermóðr the Brave volunteered to ride to Hel (the underworld) to negotiate Baldr's return. Odin lent him Sleipnir.

For nine nights, Hermóðr rode through dark valleys until reaching the river Gjöll and the gates of Hel. Sleipnir leaped over the gates, and Hermóðr met Hel, the goddess of death. She agreed to release Baldr if all things wept for him—but one jötunn (Loki in disguise) refused, and Baldr remained dead.

#### 3. Odin's Travels

As Odin's mount, Sleipnir carries the Allfather on:
- Journeys to the Well of Wisdom
- Travels through the Nine Worlds
- Shamanic quests for knowledge
- Supervision of Midgard (the world of humans)

#### 4. The Fastest Steed

Sleipnir is renowned throughout mythology as the swiftest horse, able to outrun any creature. His eight legs grant him unmatched speed on land, sea, and air.
