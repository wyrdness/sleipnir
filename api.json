      "summary": "The eight-legged horse of Odin in Norse mythology, fastest of all horses, capable of traveling between the Nine Worlds. Born from Loki in mare form after mating with the stallion Svaðilfari.",
      "full": "Sleipnir is the eight-legged grey horse of Odin, the Allfather in Norse mythology. Born from the trickster god Loki (who transformed into a mare) and the jötunn's stallion Svaðilfari, Sleipnir is described as the best and fastest of all horses. With eight legs, Sleipnir can travel across land, sea, and air, and journey between the Nine Worlds of Norse cosmology, including the realm of the dead. The horse famously carried Hermóðr to Hel in an attempt to retrieve the god Baldr. Sleipnir's teeth are carved with runes, marking his magical nature. As Odin's exclusive mount, Sleipnir symbolizes shamanic journeys, the crossing of boundaries between life and death, and the ability to traverse all realms of existence. The eight-legged horse appears throughout Norse mythology and art as an emblem of supernatural travel and divine power."
